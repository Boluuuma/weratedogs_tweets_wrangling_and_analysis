### Methods Used 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
  
### Technologies  
* Python3
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 
  
## Project Description

In this project, the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs will be wrangled, analysed and visualized. The wrangling reports will be documented in a report. Furthermore, the visualizations produced from the wrangled data, and the insights from the analysis will be documented in another report. 

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's  dogs with a humorous content about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. while the numerators are almost always greater than 10. WeRateDogs has over a million followers and has received international media coverage. The data will be gathered from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. Next, it will be assessed for quality and tidiness issues before it is cleaned. 

The wrangled data contains 1993 of WeRateDogs original ratings before 01 August 2017 excluding retweets. It also contains the predictions of the breeds of the dogs in the the tweets gotten by running the images in the tweets through a neural network.
